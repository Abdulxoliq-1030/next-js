React Js vs Next Js

By default, Next JS pre-renders every page in the application


What does pre-render mean?

Next JS generates HTML for each page in advance instead of having it all done by client-side Javascript



why pre-rendering?

Pre-rendering improves performance
   In a React app, you need to wait for the Javascript to be executed

   Perhaps fetch data from an external API and then render the UI

   There is a wait time for the user

   With a pre-rendered page, the HTML is already generated and loads faster

Pre-rendering helps with SEO
   If you're building a blog or an e-commerce site,SEO is a concern

   With a React app, if the search engine hits your page, it only sees a div tag with id equal to root

   If search engine hits a pre-rendered page though, all the content is present in the source code which will help index that page

   If SEO is of concern for your app,pre-rendering is what you want
